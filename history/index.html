<section class="hero"><div class="container"><h1>The History of Mesa Verde</h1><p>Over 700 years of Ancestral Puebloan civilization preserved in stone and earth.</p></div></section><section><div class="container"><h2>The Ancestral Puebloans</h2><p>The Ancestral Puebloan people, sometimes called the Anasazi, lived in the Mesa Verde region from approximately 550 AD to 1300 AD. Their civilization evolved through distinct phases — from early pithouses dug into the mesa top, to above-ground pueblos built from stone and mortar, to the iconic cliff dwellings constructed in natural alcoves in the canyon walls during the final century of occupation.</p><p>These were not primitive people. They developed sophisticated agricultural techniques, complex water management systems, extensive trade networks reaching hundreds of miles, and a rich artistic tradition expressed through pottery, weaving, jewelry, and rock art. Their architectural achievements — particularly the cliff dwellings — demonstrate advanced engineering knowledge including load-bearing walls, multi-story construction, and astronomical alignments.</p><h2>Why They Left</h2><p>Around 1300 AD, the Ancestral Puebloans migrated from Mesa Verde, likely due to a combination of prolonged drought, resource depletion, and social pressures. They did not disappear — their descendants are the modern Pueblo peoples of the Rio Grande valley, Hopi, Zuni, and Acoma, who maintain cultural connections to Mesa Verde and consider it a sacred ancestral homeland. Understanding this continuity is essential to appreciating Mesa Verde not as a dead site but as a living part of Native American heritage.</p></div></section>
